# Clean Code with ES6: ExpressJS + ReactJS

The is part one in a short series of articles that focuses on creating and deploying a barebones,  fullstack blog site using ES6+ Javascript, React, Redux, ExpressJS, and MongoDB. 

In these articles, I really try to focus on some of the ways I have found to set up and organize my code using ES6+ JavaScript and what I call "Redux-style" project structuring. The goal is to write code that is readable, extensible, and easily testable.

This series will be broken up into several parts:

1. Setting Up ExpressJS to use ES6+ Syntax üëàüèΩ *You Are Here*
2. Redux-Style File Structure
3. Creating a Simple Express Server
4. Setting up Mongoose with Our Blog
5. Creating a React Blog with CMS
6. Adding Redux to your Frontend
7. Wrapping Up Your App: Deployment

# Part 1: Setting Up ExpressJS to use ES6+ Syntax

ES6+ on the backend? Sure! The newest Javascript syntax really goes a long way in making code clean and readable. After all, [code is for humans to read not machines.](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/front/node3.html)

(Not an ES6+ afficionado? You might want to [brush up on the syntax.](http://es6-features.org/) I won't do much explaining here.)

Also, keep in mind that we are _not_ going to develop our application using testing. This is purely for simplicity's sake in this tutorial series. Writing good tests _"√† la TDD"_ is the **first** step to writing solid code.

## Backend Directory Layout

We'll start by creating a directory with the following file structure and an empty `index.js` file:

```
üìÅ/
	üìÇconfigs/
	üìÇdatabase/
	üìÇroutes/
	üìÑindex.js

```

## Installing Prequisites

### Yarn

We'll be using **yarn** instead of **npm** to install and run our packages. Let's initialize our project. In the root directory, type:

`yarn init -y`

This will create a very simple `package.json` file with the following contents:

*./package.json:*

~~~javascript
{
  "name": "backend",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "license": "MIT"
}
~~~

### ExpressJS

We'll be using [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/) to create a server. It's a fantastic, minimalist NodeJS framework which is both powerful and flexible. We'll also install [Nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon), a great development tool which watches our directory for changes and reloads the node server.

`yarn add express nodemon -S`

### Babel

Since we're using ES6+ syntax with ExpressJS over NodeJS, we need to make sure to transpile it down to ES5. There are several step involved.

#### __1. Install Babel Packages__

We'll use Babel to transpile our packages to ES5. Here we install the Babel CLI and the "ENV", which ["automatically determines the Babel plugins you need based on your supported environments."](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/preset-env/). 

`yarn add babel-cli babel-preset-env -D`

#### __2. Create a `.babelrc` file__
	
Now we need to create a file that tells Babel to grab the most current NodeJS presets. Create a `.babelrc` file in the root directory and add the following code:

*./.babelrc:*

~~~javascript
{
  "presets": [
    [
      "env",
      {
        "targets": {
          "node": "current"
        }
      }
    ]
  ]
}
~~~

#### __3. Create a script in our `package.json`__

Let's open our `package.json` file and modify it to run Nodemon using the babel-node presets. Here's what our `package.json` should look like (not counting versions, of course).

*./package.json:*

~~~javascript
{
  "name": "backend",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "license": "MIT",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "nodemon --exec yarn babel-node -- index.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.16.3",
    "nodemon": "^1.17.2"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "babel-cli": "^6.26.0",
    "babel-preset-env": "^1.6.1"
  }
}
~~~

üî¨ The script starts Nodemon at the `index.js` file using Babel-node presets

#### __4. Test It Out!__

Let's add some code to our `index.js` to see if it works. Add the following test code to the `index.js` in the root directory:

*./index.js:*

~~~javascript
import express from 'express'

console.log('It Works!')
~~~

If you enter the command `yarn start` in your terminal, you should get something like this:

_console:_

```
yarn run v1.3.2
$ nodemon --exec yarn babel-node -- index.js
[nodemon] 1.17.2
[nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
[nodemon] watching: *.*
[nodemon] starting `yarn babel-node index.js`
$ /Users/USER/CleanCode/backend/node_modules/.bin/babel-node index.js
It works!
[nodemon] clean exit - waiting for changes before restart
```

That's exactly what we want. It shows us that we were able to run the `index.js` file with the ES6+ syntax. It doesn't do much but that's a great start and exactly what we needed to get start.

## What's Next?

In this article, we learned how to enable ES6+ JavaScript syntax in an ExpressJS server. In next article, we'll learn about the "Redux style" export/import technique that ensures more accurate code and less headaches. Stay tuned!
