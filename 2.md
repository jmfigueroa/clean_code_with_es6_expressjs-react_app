# Clean Code with ES6: ExpressJS + ReactJS

The is part one in a short series of articles that focuses on creating and deploying a barebones,  fullstack blog site using ES6+ Javascript, React, Redux, ExpressJS, and MongoDB. 

In these articles, I really try to focus on some of the ways I have found to set up and organize my code using ES6+ JavaScript and what I call "Redux-style" project structuring. The goal is to write code that is readable, extensible, and easily testable.

This series will be broken up into several parts:

1. Setting Up ExpressJS to use ES6+ Syntax 
2. Redux-Style File Structure üëàüèΩ *You Are Here*
3. Creating a Simple Express Server
4. Setting up Mongoose with Our Blog
5. Creating a React Blog with CMS
6. Adding Redux to your Frontend
7. Wrapping Up Your App: Deployment

## Part 2: Redux-Style File Structure

Now that we're all set up with ES6+, let's talk about how we can use a technique I call "Redux-Style" to organize our server in a way that ensures accurate and meaningful code. This method is *not* specific to Redux but is commonly used *with* Redux.

With ES6+ syntax, if a directory if referenced (and *not* a specific file), Node looks for an `index.js` file in that directory to tell it what to do. The goal is to export functions and constants from other files in the same directory *through* the `index.js`. We can use this feature to gather up all of our functions and constants and export them through the `index.js`. 

Let's see this in action: We'll create a file named `server.js` and **another** `index.js` file in our `üìÇconfigs/` directory. Our file structure should now look like this:

```
üìÅ/
	üìÇconfigs/
		üìÑindex.js
		üìÑserver.js
	üìÇdatabase/
	üìÇroutes/
	üìÑindex.js
	üìÑ.babelrc
	üìÑpackage.json
	üìÑyarn.lock

```

Add the following code the the respective files:

*./configs/server.js*

~~~javascript
export const configureServer = () => {
	console.log('Server Configs!')
	}
~~~

*./configs/index.js*

~~~javascript
export * from './server'
~~~

Now, add the following code to the `index.js` in the **ROOT directory**. Note `import` statement with the empty `{}`:

~~~javascript
import {} from './configs'
~~~

In most IDEs like VS Code and Atom, if you start typing the name of our function in the `{}` in the import statement, `configureServer()`, you'll see that it auto suggests the function. Ooooh! But this is more than just magic üßôüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. This is an excellent way of verifying that we have the correct names for our constants and functions!

Currently, we're only exporting the `configureServer()` function from `server.js` using `export` before naming our function but we'll create other files with constants as well and gather them up in the same `index.js` for export and use in other files.

This is a popular way of organizing code in Redux which I find great for two reasons: 

1. It keeps our code modularized. This makes it easier to test.
2. It allows to verify that we have the correct names for functions and constants. Most text editors, like VS Code and Atom, autofill available exports from a directory.

If you've used React, you're probably familiar with using `import` with `{}`. The syntax is similar to *destructuring* in ES6 and works similarly, although they are different things. I like to think of it this way: 

- **Without** `{}`, we're gathering up all of a module's exports and importing an under one name. Of course, we can still call them individually using the dot notation:

~~~javascript
import React from 'react'

class App extends React.Component{...
~~~

- **With** the `{}`, we're grabbing only the exports what we need. 

~~~javascript
import React, {Component} from 'react'

class App extends Component{... 
~~~

Keep in mind that you can't use `export default` with this method since you'll need to be explicit about what you're exporting. For example, with React, we'd write: 

`export class Login extends React.Component{...` 

and *not:* 

`export default class Login extends React.Component{...`

## What's Next?

In this article, we learned about the "Redux-style" export/import technique that ensure more accurate code and less headaches. In the next article, we'll set up a barebones Express server using what we've learned in these two articles! Stay tuned!
