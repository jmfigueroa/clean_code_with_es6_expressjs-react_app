# Clean Code with ES6: ExpressJS + ReactJS

The is part one in a short series of articles that focuses on creating and deploying a barebones,  fullstack blog site using ES6+ Javascript, React, Redux, ExpressJS, and MongoDB. 

In these articles, I really try to focus on some of the ways I have found to set up and organize my code using ES6+ JavaScript and what I call "Redux-style" project structuring. The goal is to write code that is readable, extensible, and easily testable.

This series will be broken up into several parts:

1. Setting Up ExpressJS to use ES6+ Syntax 
2. Redux-Style File Structure 
3. Creating a Simple Express Server
4. Setting up Mongoose with Our Blog 👈🏽 *You Are Here*
5. Creating a React Blog with CMS
6. Adding Redux to your Frontend
7. Wrapping Up Your App: Deployment

## Setting up Mongoose with Our Blog

For this tutorial, we'll be setting up a database connection to a [MongoDB NoSQL database](https://docs.mongodb.com/). I'll also assume that you already have it installed and running. Click [here](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/) if you don't.

First, we'll need [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) so we Node can interact with our Mongo databse. Install it with yarn:

~~~
yarn add mongoose -S
~~~

Next, in the `📂configs/` directory, create a file named `db.js` and add the following code:

*./configs/db.js:*

~~~javascript
import mongoose from 'mongoose'
let dbPort = 'mongodb://localhost/testapp'
//
export const configureDb = app => {
  mongoose.connect(dbPort)
  mongoose.connection.on('connected', err => {
    if (err) {
      console.log(err)
    }
    console.log('MongoDB Connected: ' + dbPort)
  })
  return app
}
~~~

🔬 Here we're doing the following: 

1. Specify the port of our Mongo database
2. Create our function `configureDb()` function
3. Tell Mongoose to connect to the database with `mongoose.connect()`
4. Tell Mongoose to report on that connect with `mongoose.connection.on()`, sending us an error or telling us where it connected

Since we exported our function with `export const configureDb()...`, we need to export it through our `index.js` in our `📂configs/` directory. Update the file by adding the following code:

~~~javascript
export * from './db'
~~~

All that's left (for now) is to import the function in our main `index.js` in the **root** directory. Update the file with the following code:

*./index.js:*
~~~javascript
// CONFIGS
import {configureServer, configureDb} from './configs'
configureServer(app)
configureDb(app)
~~~

🔬 If you're using a text editor like VS Code or Atom, you should see it suggest the function we specified. If not, double check that you've specified the exports correctly.


Since we're using MongoDB, we'll also need to set up our models. Again, I won't go over the specifics of setting up Mongoose/MongoDB with your app but you can read [this excellent tutorial](https://scotch.io/tutorials/using-mongoosejs-in-node-js-and-mongodb-applications).



*./database/publicModel.js:*

~~~javascript
import mongoose, { Schema } from 'mongoose'
//
const WidgetSchema = Schema({
  status: {
    type: Boolean,
    default: false
  },
  message: {
    type: String,
    default: 'empty'
  },
  widget: {
    type: String
  }
})
//
export const WidgetModel = mongoose.model('WidgetModel', WidgetSchema)
~~~



*./database/widgetActions:*

~~~javascript
import { WidgetModel as Widget } from './'
import chalk from 'chalk'
//
export const getAllWidgets = (req, res) => {
  Widget.find({}, (err, widgets) => {
    if (err) {
      console.log(chalk.redBright(err))
      res.json({
        status: false,
        error: 'Error!!'
      })
    } else {
      res.json({ status: true, widgets: widgets })
    }
  })
}
//
export const postWidget = (req, res) => {
  let widget = new Widget(req.body)
  widget.save((err, widgets) => {
    if (err) {
      res.json({ status: false, error: 'Something went wrong!' })
    } else {
      res.json({
        status: true,
        message: req.body.message,
        widget: req.body.widget
      })
    }
  })
}
