# Clean Code with ES6: ExpressJS + ReactJS

This is a short series of articles that focuses on creating and deploying a barebones, fullstack blog site using ES6+ Javascript, React, Redux, ExpressJS, and MongoDB.

The first three articles have been published through [ITNEXT.io](itnext.io) (see links below).

In these articles, I really try to focus on some of the ways I have found to set up and organize my code using ES6+ JavaScript and what I call "Redux-style" project structuring. The goal is to write code that is readable, extensible, and easily testable.

This series will be broken up into several parts:

1.  [Setting Up ExpressJS to use ES6+ Syntax](https://itnext.io/clean-code-with-react-expressjs-and-mongodb-part-1-aa6b1a4aef82)

3.  [Creating a Simple Express Server](https://itnext.io/clean-code-with-es6-expressjs-reactjs-part-3-2306b1f62c26)
4.  Setting up Mongoose with Our Blog
